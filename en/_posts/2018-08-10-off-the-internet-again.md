Hey there! Next week will be my first day in college so I'll be inactive so two or three weeks.

You may note that I'm already inactive at some projects, that's not because it's abandoned. It's just me that tries to switch focus to new project. Just, hmm.. Keep failing at all time :/

After that, I'll be back with couple of updates for the assets.

Stay tuned!
