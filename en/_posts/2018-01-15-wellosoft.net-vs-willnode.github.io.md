title: wellosoft.net vs willnode.github.io
---

Honestly I prefer [wellosoft.net](http://wellosoft.net) to be used for all my projects, unfornately it doesn't have SSL (HTTPS) enabled. So I'd stick with [willnode.github.io](https://willnode.github.io) which is mandatory for free.

## Why SSL

So I can put my javascript bundle into Codepen.

## Why not add SSL

Frankly my domain where I buy put additional change for it ðŸ¤”
