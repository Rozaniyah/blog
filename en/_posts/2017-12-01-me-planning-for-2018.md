title: "Me Planning for 2018"
---

No matter what we do, planning is the key. Harry Potter doesn't die in the first novel, so do I.

## What I've done in 2017

I don't produce a lot the first quarter, mostly because I was having a [new blog][obsblog] (which now obsolete) and busy for the final exam (before graduate!) at my high school. Yup, you read that right. I'm going 17th at the stage.

The second quarter is my freedom. Many projects (especially [Unity Assets][unitys]) haven't been updated, so then I constantly burning my hands coding on big projects like [TEXDraw][texdraw] and [Engine4][engine4] (that one took months). At the time I write this I took holiday to celebrate what I've done there.

In this third quarter, I made (not so) risky choice to not going to college (this year) in hopes that I can learn more as a programmer. Yep, it's true, I've been diving into JavaScript (though I get [frustrated][mefrustate] with it) for the last month. I believe I can get this done by the end of the year.

## So what I'll do for 2018?

Well, novels don't rewrite their ongoing story. I need to *iterate* from what I've done this year.

This is tough because I'll run out of free time after six months. This opportunity is happening once in a lifetime so I'm not gonna waste it.

> ... *After an hour* ...

It's hard. I still can't decide what's best for me. It's really hard for a small guy like me think big....

FYI, I need you to know that I like to create things procedurally using code. This leads me to TEXDraw and Engine4 for the past few years......

> ... *After an hour again* ...

Ah! Choosing is really hard! I need to write options here:

+ Create things like (another) TEXDraw again and starts selling them somewhere.
+ Investing in someone else code (in GitHub) and make impacts while gaining popularity.
+ Promoting stuff what I've built (while making income from Ads on Youtube).
+ Making series of things and make it a sustainable income (via Patreon or something).
+ Chill and enjoy wasting time with books full of drama and thoughts.
+ Learn jack-and-trading and start to invest in things like Bitcoin and get rich.
+ Start investing with real money and start creating serious businesses.
+ I think it's enough.

## Thoughts on these options

> Create things like (another) TEXDraw again and starts selling them somewhere.

It's been three years I'm doing things like this -- I wish I can I do this again. But six months is too short for creating another thing from scratch that has quality's comparable to TEXDraw and Engine4. Besides, deep inside my heart, I can't rely on such things because too much responsibility it takes for not going to OSS (Open Source) and sales may often fluctuate in future.

> Investing in someone else code (in GitHub) and make impacts while gaining popularity.

It's true! I'm planning on this since realizing that I've been frequent in GitHub. Though I'm sure risking myself because I'm 100% sure will never get paid contributing to OSS. From [the guide][ossguide], we know that most OSS development happens during free time, so I have six months to get people attention and filling the portfolio (with a hundred repo!).

> Promoting stuff what I've built (while making income from Ads in Youtube).

OK. I don't know if people doing this, but it may worth a try. I do in fact have [a channel][yt] (with few videos) that have (few) hundred views. I can deal with it as seeds, but of course, I need to reach attention from many people.

> Making series of things and make it a sustainable income (via Patreon or something).

This. I hear with [Patreon][pt] you can get a sustainable, stable monthly income. But at this time I very unlikely to do this because I don't know *what* I can certainly create. I might wait to see until one of my works be noticeably popular.

> Chill and enjoy wasting time with books full of drama and thoughts.

I have a library card but I don't use it for last months. I might no longer need it for 2018 unless the books are cool. I thought I can be cool like Elon Musk doing back in the youth, turns out it's much harder than that.

> Learn jack-and-trading and start to invest in things like Bitcoin and get rich.

I have an interest in this kind of area, but I'm afraid because of lack of knowledge. I'll start paying attention to this when I have my own credit card, maybe 2020 or sometime.

> Start investing with real money and start creating serious businesses.

Do I have a lot of money? Yes. Do I use it? No. Why don't I use it? Because I don't have a credit card, even a bank account. So why I collect money? So I can show to my parents that programmers can survive.

> I think it's enough.

Yes. And head over to conclusion below.

## Conclusion

**Get Popular. Get Promoted. Make Impact. Create Businesses. In these order.**

Of course, [92%][really] of people's new year resolution is biased. So I must be not too strict. And stay flexible!
