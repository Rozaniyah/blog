title: NodeJS and microservices

So I just heard about Node.JS, and it is awesooooooome!

## Javascript is Awesome

NodeJS is an Javascript Intepreter, built because making a HTTP server is suck at the time. But because Javascript was suck too, it had a clever solution to make it modular:

```js
var foo = require('bar');
```

```js
module.exports = 'baz';
```

See? no new syntax is necessary. Simple enough to make it so modular. No external project config (Hi C#) needed.

And look at those new syntax sugars that Javascript had evolved in the last few years. NodeJS simply had a good invesment on that.

## Microservices
