title: Do I need open source?
---

From perspective of a guy who already making profit from closed source tools, deciding to move into open source is... really hard. Let alone my initiative to be *crowdsourced* on Patreon.

## Why I consider moving

The time that TEXDraw being popular, it make my confidence boost so big that I can make more tools, and then sell it at my willing.

However, saying is easy. Turns out I'd stuck with that. What are the tool that *selling*? Even worse I only have [one] asset, that also don't deserve the right attention.

Witout Open sourcing thing, I just broke running out fuel to keep me creative.

## Open Source

The time that I spent 4 months to learn [Javascript](/en/modern-javascript) is like being punched-in-the-ass. The Javascript community in my opinition, is very strong with its Open Source culture. Javascript and Web development was doomed to be sucks but then their community turned it to be the most expressive language I ever know.

I know some top open source programmers, like Evan, Sebastian, Sindre and many other; they're pretty hardcore. I really dearly love to know deeply each story of them. I just began to drunk with that. If you want an example, [I found one](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/sindre-sorhus-8426c0ed785d) that excellent.

## The Struggle of Being OSS

I'd say it's cool to share the stuff that you care to everyone down the earth. But...

### LICENSE

There was a time that React, the most populous Javascript framework, was [*not* licensed in MIT](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/). Everybody [simply yell at that pretty badly](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/facebook-just-changed-the-license-on-react-heres-a-2-minute-explanation-why-5878478913b2). Luckily at that time I wasn't even know what framework is so I got my butt safe.

The thing is, when the LICENSE is not MIT, everyone that depends on it might got in trouble, and we sure like to avoid to mess with lawyers, right?

### README

...or the way to engage guests to your repo.

For real, I have created over thirty (30!) repositories and no single repo have over 20 ⭐. So sad 😢.

I found a great resource for this, but then will it be worth it?

### ISSUES

Someone on SO (sorry forgot the link) ask why often free software are not released as open source.

> Because the maker don't give a damn to technical questions

So yeah, have you seen how NPM maintainer struggling with the overwhelming issues, or the story that lead John Resig giving away JQuery and Sebastian with Babel?

It's also normal for newbies to ask to the author about problem they had via social media, which is very discouraged. For real I said so because [I've mistakenly doing that way](https://twitter.com/willnode/status/952803217934397440).

I haven't any repo that gotten popular, so it both forgiving and cursing and the same time, so do the reverse. Be responsible if you want to submit an issue.

### PULL REQUESTS (CONTRIBUTING)

This is perhaps the most terrifying and chalengging thing that dwarfes newbies... Pull Request.

Most first timers began with improving documentation or README, or perhaps updating depedencies. However when you intend to add/improve/fix things, it gonna be serious.

First stuff, you need to know [how PR works](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Be careful with what you're doing and watch every commit you made. And finally, give the description properly and be helpful.

Dude I'm serious here. To give you demonstration, In [my first real PR](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gh-latest-repos/pull/9), I was panicking when my PR get fail on tests while it just matter of double quotes (I wasn't knew about style linters before) and the worst, it hadn't been merged to this date.

In my most recent PR, I had submitted [a design PR](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3922) with real damn good close ups, yet only been merged a week later when I gave them another damn good explanation. Gosh, I just satisfied when @donokuda greet me with emoji before merging the PR. It just made my week.

The last thing that I you to keep note, keep a damn respect to maintainer that will respond to your PR. Trust me it pays good both to you and the maintainer.

### MONEY

This is perhaps the most sensitive thing that dev who commit will talk about when doing a full dedication to open source. But when the community speaks, anything can happen.

I've took a note some successful OSS hardcore who getting paid committed to Open Source, also some others that being raised in groups like Open Collective. I don't have to put links now, because @feross already [have the list](https://github.com/feross/thanks/blob/master/index.js) for the [tool he made](https://github.com/feross/thanks).

But anyway, looking at the success stories, I'd like to follow the trend, however have you see my contribution graph?

![The graph in Jan 2018]({{site.img}}contib-graph-jan18.png)

Yeah, I made 150+ commits in this 2018 yet don't get attention I deserve. Yes I still likely to do this but I think will stay on the same boat.

## The Fate

For more than two year, my premium tools cover my financial need. I might won't have a chance diving to OSS if that don't happen!

By this state it might be better to make open source stuff be as a side-project. Let's hope the time will change that.

Also I think I need strategy when making tools, because I saw that people only care about tools if they depends on it (means quantity doesn't matter at all)
