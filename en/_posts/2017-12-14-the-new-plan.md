title: The new plan
---

2018 is almost coming. This will officially became my motto:

> Fast

That's right. I need to iterate software as fast as I can. So I can publish more apps in a month. Wouldn't that be awesome? By the way I flat-out my plan for upcoming project in 2018 [here](/expertise/), so I can keep in productive. This month is gonna a big month so I need to gotta go. Wish me luck!
