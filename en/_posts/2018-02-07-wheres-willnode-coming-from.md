title: Where's willnode coming from?
---

Back in 2 years ago. I was new to the Unity (my first) forum communities. I have no idea how username works so I just pull my real name on it.

> Wildan Mubarok

Yeah, I believe it's hard to read for english speakers, and I see the trends out there that user names are 'nickname' or 'slang' so I ask to support ticket to change my username.

> This is me, I want to change 'Wildan Mubarok' to 'WellDone'

Well, that's was my gut thinking first. *wil* as *well* and *dan* as *done*. Both pronounces similar I thought.

> The support guy: 'WellDone' username has been taken. We'll use 'WellDone0'

Ouch! That's ugly. I ask again about alternatives and I let them choose the best.

> The support guy: Good news! The name 'WillNode' is available. The change takes effect shortly...

Ah yes! No more numbers. I accept that name and get the case solved fast.

## Months Later

I think `willnode` is a cool choice. That username later, I use it in other places like [github](https://github.com/willnode) and [twitter](https://github.com/willnode).

It is nice (and lucky) that `willnode` is available in any places that I've been signed up. This then become my official goto for username.

Thanks for the support guy <!-- Angie at Unity3d --> for the neat choice!
