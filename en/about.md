Me in 20 seconds:

I'm nobody but a software geek. I mainly interested in making front-web software or libraries.

I also likes to be Jack of the Trade, so I also learn to build websites and little nerdy pretending to be a security geek.

My main town is in Indonesia, does not attend college yet, but likes to puddling around with new stuff and procrastinating along deadlines. My favorite color is bluish <span style="color: white; background-color: #07c; padding: 2px">#07C</span>.

If you're wondering why I don't publish to Medium, it's because my writing are awful. Sorry.
