Me in 20 seconds:

Wildan Mubarok is nobody but a software geek. He mainly interested in making front-web software or libraries.

He also likes to be Jack of the Trade, so he also learn to build websites and little nerdy pretending to be a security geek.

His main town is in Indonesia. He does not attend college yet. But he likes to puddling around with new stuff and procrastinating along deadlines. His favorite color is bluish <span style="color: white; background-color: #07c; padding: 2px">#07C</span>.
